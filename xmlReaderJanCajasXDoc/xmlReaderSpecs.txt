Thanks for your time today. 

See the below (and the attached) for the programming test.  Let me know when you think you’ll be able to have it back to me for review.

Create a GUI using Windows Forms or WPF (or the language of your choice) that does the following:

1.       Allows the user to select an XML file to Read (assume the XML is formatted correctly like the attached).

2.       Display the contents of the file in a table

3.       Allow the user to add/edit/remove the file’s contents

4.       Allow the user to choose where to save the file back out in the same XML format              

The object is a simple object that consists of:

1.       A string representing a person’s name

2.       A date representing a person’s date of birth

3.       An integer representing the number of widgets that the person needs
